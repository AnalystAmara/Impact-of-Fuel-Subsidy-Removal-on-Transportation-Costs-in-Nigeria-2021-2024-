## Conclusion

The data clearly illustrates that the removal of fuel subsidies in 2023 significantly impacted transport costs across Nigeria. This has affected not only urban mobility but also intercity and air travel, with fuel prices continuing to be a primary driver of transport inflation. Policymakers and stakeholders in the transport sector must consider these insights for future planning, subsidy alternatives, or targeted relief programs.

## Recommendations

* Consider investing in mass transit systems to cushion the effect of fuel cost increases.

* Monitor regional disparities in transport cost to inform state-level interventions.

* Explore alternative fuels or subsidy options for public transport systems.
